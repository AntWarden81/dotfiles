# Setup
## Plugins
Install vundle, from [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). 

To use the .vimrc file, run the following command:

`ln [directory]/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`

and edit the version of your .vimrc file located wherever you cloned the github repo. Then, once you've installed vundle, open up vim and run `:PluginInstall`.

In addition, copy the `.fonts` folder to home by running `cp -r .fonts ~`.
