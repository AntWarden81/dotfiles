# Plugins
Install vundle, from [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). 

# Setup
To use the .vimrc file, run the following command:

`ln [directory]/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`

and edit the version of your .vimrc file located wherever you cloned the github repo. Then, once you've installed vundle, open up vim and run `:PluginInstall`.
